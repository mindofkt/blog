I’m listening to my classical playlist in king Louis XIV’s beautiful garden, beside the manmade canals or “little Venice”. I can mentally transport myself back in time to when the gardens were full of nobles, wigs, tights on men, live music and parties, or observe the future-past (the present) with couples trying to canoe the canal or laying beside it, runners jogging through the trees, tourists taking photos, and a multitude of languages floating around the air. This earth is beautiful. 

My travel timeline has been palindromic. I began at an Italian restaurant with mom, dad, Matt and Bre in Mississauga then I left for London, England where I found myself laying near the horse statue not far from st James park, listening to my UK icons playlist. A brief tour around south east Asia and here I am back in Europe, laying near the palace of Versailles listening to my classical playlist but this time with 5 months of adventuring, learning, and exploring sinking into my pores and weaving themselves into my subconscious and personality. 

Tomorrow I go for dinner with mom, dad, Matt and Bre at an Italian restaurant in sorrento. It’s always said that we “turn a page” or “start a new chapter” when we approach change in our storyline and maybe it’s the palindromic pattern, but seeing family again tomorrow feels more like bookends to my pilgrimage. Volume I of my epoch is coming to a close and I have a long list of acknowledgments.
