#### Lukla (2840m) to Phakding (2600m)

**8:03 pm**

We made it to Phakding (pak-ding)! \
\
After waking up at 3 am to drive to Ramachhap, we waited from 7 am to 3:30 pm for the wind to calm enough so that we could fly to Lukla. While we were waiting we slept in various positions in various places, bought bananas, and finally got a Somersby (yes, they sell them here **IN GLASS BOTTLES**). So refreshing. 

The flight to Lukla wasn‚Äôt nearly as scary as bloggers have made it out to be. I don‚Äôt even remembering landing --- the earth just met the bottom of the plane. The walk down to Phakding wasn‚Äôt so terrible either! Only like 2 hours. Veggie pagoda and fried noodles for dinner were 10/10. We are now in bed because we are *SO* tired!! My feet already hurt and today was downhill. 

Our guide Dewan is so kind, I really trust him. His English isn‚Äôt too great but he knows enough and has been to Everest base camp 8 times already! 

Anyways! We have a long uphill day tomorrow so, nighty!

### Phakding (2600m) to Namche Bazaar (3440m)

**7:35 pm**

5 hours of hiking (3 until the Sagarmatha National Park Entance, an hour break, then 2 uphill to Namche) and 5 awesome suspension bridges. Dewan says we have a good pace. The weather was **PERFECT!** We saw mountain goats, yaks, cows, horses, zupas, dogs, chickens, roosters. Some Nepalese girls said I look very white LOL. 

ugh! <video class='centre' width="320" height="240" controls="controls">
<source type="video/mp4" src="/video/day2.mp4"></source>
</video>

To say the views are stunning is an understatement. Every which way you look is an entirely new portrait. We had views of multiple different peaks, the fresh water river, which is *crystal* clear, and layers of mountains weaving into each other like clasped hands.

#### Nature is so photogenic, capturing beauty is effortless.

<<<<<<< HEAD

Teagan and I felt a little drunk walking around the bazaar because of the altitude lol. Still feeling it now. I'm *so* tired. We‚Äôre both in bed ready for sleep. It was a challenge today but we didn‚Äôt feel like it was too much to handle mentally or physically. After a while the walking becomes very meditative. No space for any other thoughts aside from the present. Trekking poles make a very big difference despite hardly putting any weight on them.

We‚Äôre meeting lots of people at random but haven‚Äôt stuck with anyone in particular. I‚Äôm sure tomorrow will be easier to meet people during our rest day; while we‚Äôre trekking up hill it‚Äôs not exactly the best time to get to know someone. We‚Äôre so focussed on each step we take. Thank goodness for mule xings, they‚Äôre like speed bumps. 

I‚Äôm trying to keep up my yoga training so I‚Äôm going to teach Teagan and maybe Dewan a class. 

# Day 3

Woke up to the sound of drums and a conch - very tribal! I feel super peaceful here. 

**12:28 pm** we walked to the Everest view point and the word of the day is *‚Äúwow‚Äù*.

I practiced a Hatha sequence on teags and afterwards I felt so much more myself and a brief deep connection with the mountains. It‚Äôs unbelievable here. And can you believe the pictures don‚Äôt do it justice??

**4:26 pm**

Right now we‚Äôre chilling in Himalayan Java - the Starbucks of Nepal. We‚Äôve been reading today and talking a lot about Teagan‚Äôs book (the art of happiness), Tibetan culture, Hindu philosophy, and now, how peaceful we feel without social media. Life is so tranquil when you‚Äôre not bombarded by other people‚Äôs voices. It makes me want to quiet my own online voice. It‚Äôs just a circus of virtue signalling anyways and I want to minimize my participation. 

**Side note:** didn‚Äôt mention this before (probably because I‚Äôm scarred) but the washroom in this tea house is the narstiest, raunchiest, most fowl washroom I have ever had the displeasure of acquainting myself with. I purposely took extra Imodium so that I can constipate myself and avoid it‚Äôs usage. The fumes could suffocate a nation. 

# Day 4

### Namche (3440m) to Tengboche (3860m) to Deboche

#### There was a clean toilet on the second floor. 
<<<<<<< HEAD

This is my favourite scenic route. We walked alongside a mountain and every turn is so different. Every element is here: wind, earth (so many green trees), water, sun (and of course, space). 

*<video class='centre' width="620" height="540" controls="controls">
<source type="video/mp4" src="/video/day4.mp4"></source>
</video>

There was no room in the inn at Tengboche so we migrated another 15 minutes to Dingboche. 

Ôøº
Ôøº<img src="/images/day4.jpg" alt="Day04" width="650"/>

We met a guy from Pakistan who has summited 6 of the 7 tallest peaks and plans to summit his last one - Everest. He has documentaries on amazon prime, one called *Beyond The Heights*. His sister is the first woman from Pakistan to summit Everest.

So amazing! We‚Äôre going to look for his tent at base camp, he said he‚Äôd make us lunch before they go up!

I did some yoga in the courtyard and what a mood changer it is!

In this tea house it‚Äôs easy to chat with people so we hung out with a trekking group before bed. 

# Day 5 

### Deboche to Dingboche (4400m)

**3:31 pm**

So far no altitude sickness (knock on wood) and I took my first solid poop today!!

Teagan and I are finding that it has become mentally draining. Physically, today was easy. Mentally, we‚Äôre a bit tired of pushing through stairs üòú. Nothings as difficult as getting to Namche but we were super fresh and ready for the challenge! 

I would say this journey is equal parts mentally and physically demanding. Those components have a reciprocal relationship; if you aren‚Äôt mentally strong, you must have extreme physical fitness to make the journey feel easy. In the same way, if you‚Äôre physically weak, you must be mentally robust to push through when it gets difficult. I feel like we have a good balance of both. I don‚Äôt feel physically sore or fatigued and mentally I‚Äôm doing okay (although I learned how to swear in Nepali just in case we have to battle more 60 degree inclines) but if I was any weaker in either regard then this wouldn‚Äôt be an enjoyable experience.

The terrain has changed lots - more shrubby plants and more sand! Feels like we‚Äôre getting closer and closer to the source of this fresh water river we‚Äôre following. 


It‚Äôs cold here.

# Day 6 

### Acclimatization Day in Dingbuche
**10:47 am**

Teagan had food poisoning all night so she‚Äôs in bed today recovering :( Dewan and I walked up to the half way viewpoint in 1 hr and 15 min (he said 2 hrs up and 1.5 hrs down so we are speedy Gonzaleses)! It was 4600m high and the route is essentially vertical. Machickney (Nepali for motherfkr)! 

I did a yoga sequence on the stones outside facing the mountains and a few strangers joined in with their own practice. This is living. I‚Äôm going to listen to Tony‚Äôs advice and never let a moment in my life feel dull.

(The village in the valley is where we started). 

#### Every turn has more mountains! I am swallowed by the Himalayas. 

**3:08 pm**

<img src="/images/day6view.jpg" alt="Day06 View" width="650"/>

I was struggling to find a word that accurately describes the balance between power and complacency that the mountains exert but I think I found it: meek. By Jordan Peterson‚Äôs definition, a warrior who is all capable of destruction and tyranny but keeps his sword sheathed is meek. These mountains decide who climbs them, who paves paths in them, and here we (the trekkers) are: observing them at peace, even though we‚Äôve just walked ourselves into the throat of the Himalayas. 

# Day 7

### Dingbuche (4400m) to Lobuche (4900m)

**2:48 pm**

<img src="/images/day7.jpg" alt="Day07" width="650"/>

##### Left foot. Right foot. Left foot. Right foot. 

Today was hard! Mentally and cardiovascularly. I had thought *‚Äúthis is unenjoyable‚Äù* as we were ascending through a mountain of rocks. Breaks help. I was thinking about what mom told me one time, *‚Äúif you want something to feel easy, do something harder‚Äù.* A lot of things are going to feel easy after this! Our stomachs were churning with every step but we made it and tomorrow is base camp day!!!!

<img src="/images/day7terrain.jpg" alt="Day07 Terrain" width="650"/>

##### SO PROUD OF US FOR MAKING IT THIS FAR.  

<img src="/images/day7memorial.jpg" alt="Day07 Memorial" width="650"/>


We walked through a memorial of sherpas and tourists who passed away on Everest. 

We‚Äôre going to walk to the Khumbu glacier in a bit but for now we‚Äôre horizontal in our teaha√ºs (the new ebc).

# Day 8

### Lobuche (4900m) to Gorakshep (5100m) to Everest Base Camp (5300m)

*(Written on day 10 bc I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to write the day of).*

<img src="/images/day8.jpeg" alt="Day08" width="650"/>

No - **THIS** was the hardest day. I feel like I saw the other side of death. I slept for four hours last night and **REALLY** felt the altitude sickness. I was stubborn and tried to avoid buying plastic water bottles but because there is no running water up here I just got super dehydrated. I felt so weak and out of it walking to EBC, which involves hiking up and across many rocks along a ridge. It was a cloudy day but I loved that ominous tone. You really feel connected to all those people in the tents planning to summit and I can completely understand how these mountains take lives. 
\
#### We saw a massive avalanche! Today the mountains are in charge. 


\
I honestly didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it back to Gorakshep (I contemplated asking to be abandoned in one of the tents and retrieved tomorrow) since I‚Äôd been feeling so nauseas and weak but Dewan gave us a bit of a bounty bar and that helped me make it. It started snowing a lot in the direction we were walking so I had one eye open and honestly just thought of me trudging through campus in the middle of January. Oddly familiar! 

<img src="/images/day8camp.jpg" alt="Day08 Base Camp" width="650"/>


Everyone seems to be struggling today. I definitely pushed my limits mentally and physically in what was **EASILY** the **HARDEST** thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life. This has been SO character revealing for me, in moments of suffering and awe (they‚Äôre usually the same moment, like at EBC) my thoughts enter different corners of my mind. I was telling Teags it‚Äôs almost like dynamic meditation where you just yell for a while until these deep rooted emotions -- either laughing or crying or anything in between, shows itself to you. In a lot of ways, this journey has been therapeutic and I think it will radically change both of us. 

# Day 9 

### Gorakshep (5100m) to Pengboche (3985m)

Last night we slept in a tea house that was entirely slanted. When I laid on my bed, I slid to the wall. And it was **SO** rock hard solid my mind went to how grandpa had to sleep on the ground when he returned home because he was so used to conditions at war. It's impressive that he slept that way in trenches for so long, two nights in hard beds and my upper body feels broken!! I feel guilty for complaining. I have a bruise on my left hip bone from the beds. It‚Äôs also snowing in our room and **HOW IS THERE A DOG AT THIS ALTITUDE BARKING ALL NIGHT?** I was in tears as I sipped the one tablespoon of porridge that I could stomach all day because I wanted to get out so badly and down to the warmth and where the trees are and life is!

We walked down and ran into our friends, the American couple and the Georgian brothers, who played us a song of theirs by the Everest memorial. For a moment, all my stomach and nausea pain went away. What a surreal scene, listening to people express themselves in front of the most beautiful backdrop of the Himalayas. 

*<video class='centre' width="620" height="540" controls="controls">
<source type="video/mp4" src="/video/day9.mp4"></source>
</video>

The first part of the day was hard but it got better as it went on. We got to our tea house with only 6 tourists in total: a couple from Costa Rica who have been married for over a decade with no kids and a love for adventure, and two Canadians that went to Queens. One of them really intrigued me. He was ecommerce but is super combative against consumerism so it‚Äôd be interesting to pick his brain about it.  Oh well, they‚Äôre going up and thankfully we‚Äôre going down now!! 

# Day 10 

### Pengboche (3985m) to Namche (3440m)
<<<<<<< HEAD

Ah Namche!! I was feeling stomach pain and severe lightheadedness from my lack of appetite (I skipped breakfast and lunch for the past 2 days and breakfast today... I‚Äôm also shitting rain so I‚Äôm super dehydrated) but talking to the American couple got me out of my head for a bit!!

I still remember day 1 in Ramechhap when they hated their dal vhaat meal üòÇ they‚Äôre such a sweet couple and the guy is jokes. The girl (we still don‚Äôt know each other‚Äôs names, which seems to be the common theme with meeting new people) described EBC the best: it is like how we might imagine the moon to be -- dry and lifeless. It definitely feels like we‚Äôve travelled to the moon and back!

We got a nice tea house this time and as soon as my head hit the pillow I was out!! My body is in need of much recovery.  

Finally, back to good sleep!! The Sherpa family here is so kind and welcoming and we ate our first full meal in a few days (10 momos each). The grandfather of the family has summited Everest **TWICE.** 

# Day 11 

### Namche (3440m) to Lukla

We basically **SPRINTED** back because we were so excited to be done! What a machickney journey! All our friends went to the ‚ÄúIrish pub‚Äù (basically a grandmothers house on the main floor and frat house on the basement) for a celebratory drink! Cool to connect with all the travellers we met in passing. We were all in this together! 

# Day 12

### Lukla to KTM

We missed our flight to Ramechhap but caught one to Kathmandu (thank goodness) and **THAT** was the scary ride of my life I‚Äôve been waiting for! The plane was constantly dropping and I yelled ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù a few times. I even started thinking about all the bad karma I deserve that would maybe cause the universe to bite me now! But we made it!! Home sweet home in Kathmanpoo üòä what a journey from beginning to end!
